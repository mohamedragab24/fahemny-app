/**
 * This Firestore Security Ruleset is designed for the ConnectNow application, a platform connecting employers and freelancers.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * The security model prioritizes authorization independence and data integrity. It enforces strict ownership for user-specific data and enables a public marketplace for projects. Access control decisions are made using denormalized owner IDs (e.g., `employerId`, `freelancerId`) directly on the documents being secured, which ensures rules are both performant and easy to understand.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The data is organized into four top-level collections:
 * - /userProfiles/{userId}: Stores private user data, accessible only by the owner.
 * - /projects/{projectId}: A public collection of projects that anyone can read.
 * - /offers/{offerId}: A semi-private collection of offers for projects.
 * - /messages/{messageId}: A private collection for direct messages between users.
 * This flat structure avoids complex hierarchical security dependencies.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User Enumeration: Listing all users from the `/userProfiles` collection is explicitly disallowed to protect user privacy.
 * - Public Marketplace: The `/projects` collection is publicly readable to allow freelancers to browse and discover work opportunities.
 * - Write Integrity: All write operations (create, update, delete) are strictly controlled. Projects can only be modified by their owner (`employerId`). Offers can only be modified by the freelancer who created them (`freelancerId`).
 * - Shared Access: Access to `offers` is granted to both the freelancer who made the offer and the employer who owns the project. Access to `messages` is restricted to the sender and receiver only.
 * - Immutability: Critical relational IDs like `employerId`, `freelancerId`, `senderId`, and `receiverId` are enforced as immutable after creation to maintain data consistency.
